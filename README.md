# torchbench :fire: :stopwatch:

This repository contains various performance benchmarks for the R packages [`torch`](https://github.com/mlverse/torch) and [`mlr3torch`](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3torch) and compares them with [`PyTorch`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
The goal is twofold:

1. Give users of the packages a quick overview of what to expect.
2. Use these benchmarks to drive optimizations.

To ensure reproducibility, these benchmarks will (in the future) be run in a containerized environment.

The results can be found on the [website](https://sebffischer.github.io/torchbench).
